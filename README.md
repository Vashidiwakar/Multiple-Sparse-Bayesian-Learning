##  Overview

This work implements the **Multiple Sparse Bayesian Learning (MSBL)** algorithm to solve the **Simultaneous Sparse Approximation Problem**.

---

##  Highlights

- **Bayesian Framework:** Uses an empirical Bayes (Type-II ML) approach with hierarchical priors.
- **Joint Sparsity:** MSBL enforces common sparsity across multiple signals.
- **Closed-form EM Updates:** Efficient parameter updates for MSBL.
- **Fair Evaluation:** Comparison between SBL and MSBL algorithm has been done.
